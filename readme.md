## Description:

 This project is a Node.js application that creates a simple API endpoint to retrieve data from a MongoDB database. It's built using Express.js for server-side routing and MongoDB for data storage.

### Key Components:

- Express.js: A Node.js web framework for building APIs and web applications.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL document database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.
- dotenv: A library for loading environment variables from a .env file.
- Cors: A middleware for enabling cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in Express.js.


### Setup:

- Install dependencies:

`npm install express mongoose cors dotenv` or `npm i`

- Create a .env file:
`port=5000`  # Replace with your desired port
`database_link=mongodb://localhost:27017/Projects ` # Replace with your MongoDB connection string
Running the Application:

- Start the MongoDB server: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running.
- Start the Node.js application:
`node app.js`

API Endpoint:

### GET /data:
- Fetches all documents from the project-list collection in the Projects database.
  - Returns the results as a JSON array.

### Additional Notes:

- The application logs MongoDB commands to the console for debugging purposes.
  - Consider using more robust error handling and input validation in production environments.
